# cpp-tries-mytry

Tried to make my version of Tries based on the wikipedia article of what Trie does (haven't looked at any source code yet)

Let's hope what I did was actually correct lmao

## Pre-Requisites
- [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) for memory leak testing

## How to run file
 You can do `g++ trie.cpp && ./a.out` but for memory leak testing you have to do some extra stuffs, I have written [a script](./runcode.sh) to somewhat help user, just do `source runcode.sh`
